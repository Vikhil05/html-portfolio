# 🌐 My HTML Portfolio

Welcome to my **HTML Portfolio**, a personal project created during my learning journey through a **Full Stack Web Development course on Udemy**.

This portfolio marks the beginning of my web development journey — built entirely with **HTML** and a touch of creativity. It showcases my understanding of web structure, content organization, and basic design using HTML elements.
